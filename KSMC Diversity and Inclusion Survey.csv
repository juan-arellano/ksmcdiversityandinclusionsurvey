There is so much more to diversity and inclusion than these things, and any level of discrimination against any of them is already illegal.  As such, what do we really hope to gain by focusing more here?  If this is where we stop, it will be beyond disappointing.  And if we end up actually applying racism, sexism, or ageism in order to ""help"" these items by promoting or treating anyone differently because of these things (like applying affirmative action), we're not making this space better.  Saying we need to have X number of a certain race, sex, sexual orientation, or age in our company, or any level of our company, discriminates against anyone who is in the majority of any of these categories, so that's clearly not the solution.  Donating money to, or partnering with, organizations that claim to work in these spaces but whose primary purpose is actually just to support one political ideology is also not helpful and hurts about half of our people.  And what about religion?  What are we doing to support our country's stance on freedom of religion and create a space where it's not spoken about negatively?  I sincerely hope that our focus in this space is more about understanding everyone and accepting them, especially if/when they have different beliefs, of any kind.  History seems to have shown that the more we focus on the differences between us, the more it actually divides us.  And we have plenty of that in society already.  I'd rather see us focus on our similarities and pursue bringing us together as people who accept one another, whether it is ""trendy"" or not."

I do think that we as an organization should be more outward facing however. It took the organization WAY too long to respond to the Black Lives Matter movement this year. I would love to see us be thought leaders in the community around inclusion.

We, like many other organizations, are aware of the importance but quite content drawing out our responses. This, of course, is both good and bad. Good, that we are trying to be intentional and thoughtful. Bad, that there is no urgency or clear visible change. There are so many clear things we can do to show a commitment to progress. An easy one would be - look at all of our expenditures in each of our communities (think everything, food, paper, ink, internet, cell phones, tshirts, insurance, etc., everything) and baseline how much of that spending goes directly into our communities and directly to XBE organizations. Then, make a clear commitment to change. "
